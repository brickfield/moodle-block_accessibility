Accessibility Block for Moodle.

Provides options for changing text size and colour scheme. Settings can be saved to persist between sessions. Colour settings can
be defined at the block instance level (Block instance configuration).

Also integrates ATbar from Southampton University ECS http://www.atbar.org. Code used under BSD Licence.

To install, place all files in /blocks/accessibility/ directory and visit /admin/index.php in your browser. To achieve block
appearance throughout entire Moodle site (so-called "Sticky block") once the plugin is installed into Moodle,
it's recommended to add its instance onto the Moodle homepage (/index.php). Homepage instance of the block enables "Page contexts"
option in block instance configuration to be set to "Display throughout entire site".
